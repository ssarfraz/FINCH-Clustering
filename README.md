# First Integer Neighbor Clustering Hierarchy (FINCH) Algorithm
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ssarfraz/FINCH-Clustering/master/data/toy_data_vis.jpg)

FINCH is a parameter-free fast and scalable clustering algorithm. it stands out for its speed and clustering quality.
 The algorithm is described in our paper **Efficient Parameter-free Clustering Using First Neighbor Relations** published in CVPR 2019 . [Read Paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2019/papers/Sarfraz_Efficient_Parameter-Free_Clustering_Using_First_Neighbor_Relations_CVPR_2019_paper.pdf).


## Installation
The project is available in PyPI. To install run:

`pip install finch-clust`  

**Optional**.  Install [PyNNDescent](https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent) to get first neighbours for large data

To install finch with pynndescent run:

`pip install "finch-clust[ann]"`  


## Usage:

typically you would run: 
``` 
from finch import FINCH
c, num_clust, req_c = FINCH(data)

```
You can set options e.g., required number of cluster or distance etc,

```
c, num_clust, req_c = FINCH(data, initial_rank=None, req_clust=None, distance='cosine', verbose=True)
```

For more details on meaning of input arguments check README in [finch directory](finch/README.md). 

**Matlab usage**

Correponding Matlab implementation is provided in the [matlab directory](https://github.com/ssarfraz/FINCH-Clustering/tree/master/matlab/README.md).

## Demos

The following demo notebooks are available to see the usage in clustering a dataset.
